Seven is a magic number. So it makes sense to start playing with some awesome magix in our seventh week of learning, right?

And so it came to be that we met [jQuery](http://jquery.com), 

> "a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library"

In other words, a powerful JavaScript tool that can turn your web app into magic. We fiddled with [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net) a bit, a great tool that lets you experiment with JavaScript and various js libraries, including jQuery. It also makes it easy to share awesome js code with others, which is what good Catz do.

If you still have no clue what all this jStuff is about, the [jQuery lessons on Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery) are your new best friend. It's not as difficult as it looks, promise.

To use jQuery in your web app, just make sure to add the right script tag before the your HTML </body> tag. (Hint: our [basic Flask app with Bootstrap](https://github.com/CodeCatz/kibble/tree/master/Flask/2013-08-14-basic-flask-app) also includes jQuery, take a look!)

While in a jQuery mood, we also got to play with the [jQuery Validation Plugin](http://jqueryvalidation.org) that can be used to validate our complexicator web forms. Useful stuff, see [CodeCatz/kibble](https://github.com/CodeCatz/kibble) for some nice [demo forms](https://github.com/CodeCatz/kibble/tree/master/jQuery/2013-08-28-jquery-form-validation). Don't forget to fork (or [sync fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork) if necessary) the kibble repo into your own account and play with this!

We also talked about [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) a bit, [Git](https://github.com/CodeCatz/kibble/tree/master/Git), and [grumpy cat](http://www.complex.com/art-design/2013/08/30-best-grumpy-cat-memes-you-can-respond-with/). Yep, we had a great time, make sure to attend next time!

#### Homework

Speaking of next time: keep on coding throughout the week, and try to find something to present that could be interesting for other Catz and Kittenz. It doesn't have to be anything big, you'll get cookiez (real ones) anyway. And keep making your web app even more awesome.
