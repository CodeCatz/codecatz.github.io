title: About CodeCatz
---

Are you female and are you learning programming because you have an awesome idea you want to build or because you’re wondering if you could turn talking to computers into a job?

Read on, dear kitten, we might just have what you’re looking for!

## Why CodeCatz?

CodeCatz is a coding study group where women are never in the minority. We meet every Wednesday and hack open source projects together because we think that’s fun and because we like learning. We also like hacking things on other days of the week and keep in touch through a private Facebook group for active members of CodeCatz. We are not a coding school.

As a member of CodeCatz, you’ll learn how to work on real-world open source projects in a team in a friendly, fun, loud environment. You can learn a lot of practical tips &amp; tricks from full-time developers if you ask the right kinds of questions. Along the way, you’ll acquire skills that can help you get an awesome job and will make you a better cat, ahem, person!

### CodeCatz are about …

*… passion, fun, friendship, sharing, getting stuff done, learning new things, open source, being active members of the development community, increasing visibility of women in tech, chocolate and (bad) singing*

### CodeCatz are not about …

*… doing homework, waiting for assignments, being quiet, sitting alone in a corner*

## Things a CodeCat needs

- a decent laptop with Linux or OS X (hint: if you need Windows for other work, consider installing [VirtualBox &amp; Ubuntu](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox))
- time, passion, stubbornness, patience, attention to detail
- willingness to learn, share code &amp; knowledge, and working on open source projects
-basic knowledge of English

P.S.: owning a cat is not necessary, but an appreciation of <a href="http://icanhas.cheezburger.com/lolcats" target="_blank">LOLcats</a> is (or at least <a href="https://twitter.com/dogsolutions" target="_blank">@DogSolutions</a>)

## Wanna join?

Do you still want to become a CodeCat after reading all of this? Awesome! You can apply by:

- Submitting a sample project. It doesn’t have to be super complex, super fancy or super pretty. We just want to see that you’re able to learn on your own and apply what you learn to project that means something to you. A HTML/CSS page about you can be a great project, as long as you hacked it together and managed to publish it online. Hint: GitHub is a great place to host your projects.<a href="#beginner">*</a>
- Having your own project that you want to develop or wanting to work on one of the <a href="/projects">projects</a> we’re currently working on. Hint: we really like open source projects.
