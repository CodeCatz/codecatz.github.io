We were all a bit tired, so we spent most of the meetup playing with [jQuery](http://codecatz.github.io/meetup/2013/08/28/meetup-7-notes-jquery.html) again. It's a strange beast with all the curly brackets and dollar signs, but we're determined to tame it because we like the fun stuff it allows us to do. Like [toggling a class on click](http://jsfiddle.net/Y9GeD/) (yes, that's our very own jsFiddle we shared!).

We also had a super awesome [introduction to UX](https://github.com/CodeCatz/kibble/tree/master/UX/2013-09-04-UX-basics) by one the the Catz. Which got us into playing with HTML5 [sliders](http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-slider/) in combination with jQuery.

On a somehow related noteâ€¦

#### Homework

Most of our web apps still need [jQuery validation](http://jqueryvalidation.org). Check out [the example in kibble](https://github.com/CodeCatz/kibble/tree/master/jQuery/2013-08-28-jquery-form-validation) and follow along. Try to find some other cool things to learn and share with the Catz.

Side note: next week [Celtra](http://www.celtra.com) will be our temporary host instead of [Zemanta](http://www.zemanta.com/). We love you both!
