## Is this a real life, is this just fantasy?

Life is a bitch, but somethimes this bitch shows some mercy... in the form of prose.io and octopress.

Which one is the uppermost feaces (i.e. top shit)? It depends on your skill level. 
For github pages and beginners prose.io is simply awesome. Everything is just a click away. But if you need more control and templates and... then use  octopress.
