- We learn [Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org).
- We can make a simple web app with [Flask and make it pretty with Bootstrap](https://github.com/CodeCatz/litterbox/blob/master/TUTORIALS/Flask_and_Bootstrap.md).
- We are getting use to Git and GitHub by filling our [litterbox](https://github.com/CodeCatz/litterbox) repo.
