### CodeCatz official webpage, 

We used Jekyll.

We are using Github pages, so we are also using a version of Jekyll, that is supported by Github pages.

### Build

run `bundle install`, which is going to install

* Jekyll
* Jekyll Plus'
* Guard
* Guard Jekyll Plus
* Guard Livereload

For live reload, you will also need to have installed a browser 
extension [LiveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei)

### Runing with live reload 
Best for development.

Just run `bundle exec guard`

Now enable live reload extension in the browser and you are done.


### Normal running of a page
 just run `jekyll serve`
